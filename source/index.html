			"Do you know why it khas the rooster?"
			The tour guide glanced around, sardonic smile acknowledging our tepid interest.  She was the picture of Baltic hipsterdom - dark clothes; searching eyes; voice dripping with sarcasm; the product of a system guaranteed to inspire a sort of general-purpose skepticism.
			Thunder boomed in the distance as we stared up at the elegant steel spire of St. Peter's Church.  The rain fell heavy on our overused umbrellas and water pooled in the crevices between the cobblestones.  The imposing Art Nouveau edifices of the surrounding buildings looked on, rendered somber by the interminable gray skies.  Our eyes fell back to the guide, now watching us with a good-natured scorn, and she continued.
			"This is Protestant city - the rooster is symbol of Lutheran church.  We khave another statue by the bus station", she added, gesturing absent-mindedly off to her right.
			"During Soviet occupation," she continued, "the Soviets did not accept religion, so upper level was converted to performance center.  You can see if you go inside."  She was looking up at the church again.
			"So", she said, turning back towards us, "we continue."
			The thunder came again with a cacophonous crash.  It was much closer now; the buildings seemed to tremble.  Members of the group started to glance around uneasily.  The guide stopped abruptly, dropping the routine disengagement and staring up at the sky.
			"Perhaps we must end early," she began, looking around intently and starting briskly across the road.  "Sky does not look so bad, but I think we khave storm coming."
			The guide stopped at the edge of the Town Hall Square and motioned for us to approach.
			"I show you one more thing."  The adrenaline spike had subsided and a measure of calm had been restored to her voice.
			"The House of Blackheads is over here," she went on hurriedly, pointing to a richly ornamented building to our left.  "It is perhaps most famous building in Riga.  Important guild called Blackheads lived here."
			"Over here," she went on, looking out over the square to our right, "is Town Hall.  Leaders would make announcements to people from balcony."
			"Across", she continued apace, "is Occupation Museum.  From 1940 to 1991, we khave been occupied by Soviets, by Nazi Germany, and again by -"...
			She was interrupted by the sound of screeching tires.  A car shrieked around the corner and came speeding across the square, horn blaring.  It barreled through the area we'd been standing as we hastily dashed to either side.  The passenger had his head out the window, shouting at our guide with a terrifying intensity as the car rushed by.
			Our guide pulled back into the shadows of one of the nearby buildings, eyes wide, glancing anxiously around.  She had forgotten us entirely.  She found an opening to a nearby cafe and darted inside.   We were alone.
			Then the rumbling came again.  Suddenly it was everywhere, shaking the buildings and knocking us off our feet... and as we stumbled to our feet, we realized that the rain had abated.  We looked across the square - someone was coming.
			A man was coming towards us, crouched down but rapidly advancing.  We started to make out a helmet; a camo outfit; a white, blue, and red striped patch on his shoulder; and, pointed at us -
			- a rifle.  We stumbled backwards.  Five more troops rounded the corner and started towards us.  A low grinding sound emerged and a long metallic tube started creeping out from behind that same corner.
			We ran.
